            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Basic Account Information:</span> When you create or reconfigure an
                account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, password and email address.
                On the Equimundo Services, your name is listed publicly, including on your
                profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some Equimundo
                Services, such as searching and viewing public user and horse profiles, do not require registration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Contact Information:</span> You must use your contact information, such as
                your email address, to customize your account or enable Services, for example, for
                login verification. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services,
                to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account. You may
                use your settings for email notifications to control notifications you receive from the Equimundo
                Services. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by editing your settings contained on our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Additional Information:</span> You may provide us with profile information to
                make public on the Equimundo Services, such as a short biography, your location, your website or date of birth.
                All this information is made public on Equimundo. We may later tailor content, such as making suggestions
                or showing user and horse accounts. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and
                contact information to respond to your request.

            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Statuses, Following, Horses and other Public Information:</span> Our Services are
                primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us
                through the Equimundo Services is information you are asking us to make public. Your public information
                includes the messages you Share for a horse; the metadata provided with statuses, such as when you posted;
                the language and time zone associated with your account; and the horses you create, horses you follow, statuses
                you mark as likest, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Equimundo Services.
                We may use this information to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize
                the content we show you, including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide
                through the Equimundo Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings
                or features, like direct messages, to make the information more private if you want. You can change the
                language associated with your account at any time using your account settings. The Equimundo Services broadly
                and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services.
                When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully
                about what you are making public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Links:</span> Equimundo may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services,
                including our email notifications by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our
                Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how
                many times a particular link was clicked on. Links, statuses, and direct messages shared on the Services will
                be processed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Cookies:</span> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect
                additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our
                Services such as searching and looking at public user and horse profiles. A cookie is a small data file that
                is transferred to your computer or mobile device. Equimundo may use both session cookies and persistent cookies
                to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic
                routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to
                place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies. We honor
                the Do Not Track browser option to give you control over how your website visits are used to personalize your Equimundo
                experience and ads.

                carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive
                Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services,
                interact with our email notifications. We may also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on
                our Services. Equimundo uses Log Data to provide, understand, and improve our Services, to make inferences, like what
                topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. If not already done earlier,
                we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email
                address, after a maximum of 18 months.

                or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal
                process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues;
                or to protect Equimundo’s rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal

                merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.
                This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about

                including the delivery of ads.

            <p>
                <span class="text-bold">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</span> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated
